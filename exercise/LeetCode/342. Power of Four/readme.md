## Power of Four
Given an integer (signed 32 bits), write a function to check whether it is a power of 4.

Example:
Given num = 16, return true. Given num = 5, return false.

Follow up: Could you solve it without loops/recursion?

## Code

```
int         : -2^31 ~ 2^31-1
是4的次方的 : 2^2n，0 <= n <= 15
```
